<a>As a passionate software engineer with a keen interest in the intersection of technology and business, I've dedicated my efforts to developing innovative solutions. My experience in machine learning and data mining has equipped me with the tools to extract valuable insights from complex datasets.

I've applied these skills to various projects, including the development of an Airbnb clone, where I delved into data analysis to optimize pricing strategies and user experiences. Additionally, I've created web crawlers to gather and process large amounts of data, enabling me to conduct in-depth research and generate data-driven insights.

I'm excited to continue exploring new opportunities and contributing to projects that leverage the power of data to drive positive change
